    <!-- 
        I want to create an app that has three basic functionalities; todo app, thing counter, and habit tracker.
        I want to make them relatively simple but still useful.
        I want the user to be able to make an account to store their information in, or if they choose not to make
        one, then the information will be stored on the local storage of the device.
        I want to implement the accounts using firebase.
        I want to finish the whole app minus firebase integration not later than March 12, 2022.
    -->

    <!-- 
        First thing I'll do is create a layout for the initial screen. It will have three buttons, that when 
        pressed will load whichever app they are associated with.
     -->

     <!-- 
         What should be expected from a basic todo-app?
